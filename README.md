### Project Description

> AirKepler is a travel booking app that is designed to find you the cheapest flights available from planet to planet. Enter your departure location, destination, and planned departure date to find the travel time, distance, and price of your travel. If you're travel plans are flexible, don't forget to check the low fares section to see the shortest and most affordable travel dates!

#### _Feature List:_

1. Research Flights:
   - calculate travel time, price, and distance with departure/arrival locations and departure date
   - have a low fares section that shows the price/distance of travel for later dates in the year (orbital changes cause the distance and price to fluctuate)
2. Book Flights:
   - user login (Auth0)
   - book flight
   - profile page showing user info and all previously booked flights
3. Economy and Premium vessels:
   - Premium vessels have a faster cruising speed, causing the travel to time to be less, but the price of the ticket to go up
